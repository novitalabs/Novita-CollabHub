2. **GitHub Exposure:** Your project collaboration details will be prominently displayed on Novita AI’s GitHub, along with an entry point for trials.
3. **Affiliate Promotion:** You can promote the template on your end as well, potentially through an affiliate model.
4. **Dedicated Blog Posts:** We’ll write a dedicated blog for your project and its template, increasing visibility and engagement.
5. **Wide Reach:** Each project template landing page will be submitted to over 100 websites for promotion.
6. **Twitter Advertising:** We’ll also run targeted ads for each template landing page on Twitter to maximize exposure.
